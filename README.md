# Foobar2000 Media Player Control in Home Assistant

This custom component allows Home Assistant to control the **Foobar2000** media player.

## 📌 Requirements

### 🔧 Foobar2000 Setup

This component requires modifications to your **Foobar2000** installation.
Refer to the [pyfoobar2k documentation](https://gitlab.com/ed0zer-projects/pyfoobar2k) for setup instructions.

## 🛠 Installation

### Manually

1. Place the `foobar2000` directory into:

   ```yaml
   <home_assistant_config_directory>/custom_components/
   ```

### Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=talmuth&repository=ha_foobar2k&category=integration)

This component depends on the Python library [pyfoobar2k](https://gitlab.com/ed0zer-projects/pyfoobar2k).

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Everything runs inside the devcontainer, which is built on the official Home Assistant image
(see `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`). Open the repo in VS Code and choose **Reopen in Container**, then:

- `scripts/develop` – start Home Assistant with this integration loaded (UI on http://localhost:8123, config in `config/`)
- `scripts/test` – run the test suite with coverage
- `scripts/lint` – format and lint with Ruff

To move to a newer Home Assistant, bump `HA_VERSION` in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` together with
`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` in `pyproject.toml` (it pins the matching `homeassistant` version).
